## Course Description
This course provides a firm grounding in computer security concepts and the basics of analyzing and 
designing security systems. Students learn about threat modeling, principles of secure design, security policies, access control technologies, and similar topics. 
During this course, I: 
1. Understood physical security and online security. 
2. Constructed a reference monitor that restricts access to network and/or disk resources for a virtual 
machine. Analysis of other students’ implementations for security flaws. 
3. Analyzed flaws in a practical system and gain experience disclosing your analysis to a product group. 
4. Obtained a deep understanding of virtualization including Type 1 (which we further subdivide by those that virtualize hardware versus a set of kernel patches that jail different VMs) and Type 2 virtualization, their implementation, and the efficiency, security, simplicity, and resource savings tradeoffs. We were tested on their knowledge of virtualization tradeoffs. 
5. Learned the basics of topics related to security including Hashing and Encryption, access control 
systems, capability systems, virtualization, anonymity networks, AI security, software supply chain 
security, attacks including SQL injection, buffer overflows, use after free, and similar issues.

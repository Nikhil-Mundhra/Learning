## Course Description
This course takes a top-down approach to computer networking. After an overview of
computer networks and the Internet, the course covers the application layer, transport
layer, network layer and link layers. Topics at the application layer include client-server
architectures, P2P architectures, DNS and HTTP and Web applications. Topics at the
transport layer include multiplexing, connectionless transport and UDP, principles or
reliable data transfer, connection-oriented transport and TCP and TCP congestion
control. Topics at the network layer include forwarding, router architecture, the IP
protocol and routing protocols including OSPF and BGP. Topics at the link layer include
multiple-access protocols, ALOHA, CSMA/CD, Ethernet, CSMA/CA, wireless 802.11
networks and link-layer switches. The course includes simple quantitative delay and
throughput modeling, socket programming and network application development.
